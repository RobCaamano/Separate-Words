# Separate-Words
Reads a line of text from the standard input and prints out the input string but with blanks inserted so that the output is a sequence of English words

Take “English words” to mean words in the file words.txt. The input is a string of lower-case letters (no punctuation or blanks). The output is the same string but with blanks inserted so that each string delimited by the blanks is a word in words.txt. If it is not possible to produce such a string, the program should print out “null”.
